    "# Introduction\n",
    "This lesson is about the core principles behind the vast majority of statistical content on the remainder of this course. Understanding these principles is fundamental for making sense of the framework we will be using for all our data analyses going forward. As such, it is vital that you study the ideas in this lesson as thoroughly as you can. We would encourage you to revisit this lesson periodically throughout the course as the more examples you are exposed to, the more this content will make sense. We want these ideas to become second nature to you, as this is the mark of a strong and skilled data analyst. However, they will not necessarily all be intuitive to you on a first read. Learning is an iterative process, so we expect you to have a go at understanding everything in here, but recognise that much of it may only start to click once you see it in action. By the end of this module, you should be able to revisit this lesson and understand it thoroughly.\n",
